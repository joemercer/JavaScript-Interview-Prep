some questions to do:

"given a vector of strings of length n with each word having a length of m on average, group all anagrams into a cluster. Do this for the case that n >>>>>> m and in the most efficient way possible. Assume extra space allowed."

"Give an array, find the pairs that their sum is equal to a target number."
- or 3 numbers that sum
- or 4, etc

"do a dynamic programming solution"
-cache the values as you go along

The online test has time and space complexity limits on the solution

Find left sibling of a given node in a tree

Given a list of names. Find whether a particular name occurs inside a given tweet or not. If found return true otherwise false Time complexity should be less than O(n). 
-build a trie
